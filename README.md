# Building Energy Domain (BED) Ontology
The Building Energy Domain Ontology is referred to as the BED ontology. BED Ontology can be used in the fields of energy management and building performance. It aims to facilitate better understanding, analysis, and communication of energy-related concepts within the building sector. The ontology is developed
based on two knowledge sources: ontology and data model.

## Ontology Development
This ontology is developed following the framework by Pan, Z., Gao, Y., Ponci, F., & Monti, A. (2023) [1].

### BED version
Different versions of BED Ontology are provided in the [Ontology folder](Ontology/)
