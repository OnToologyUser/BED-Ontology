BED Ontology is developed based on two knowledge sources: ontology and data model. Concepts and relationships from the existing ontologies
are reused such as SAREF4ENER, SAREF4BLDG, SBEO, SARGON, and EM-KPI Ontology. The data model of Questionnaire, ACMeasurement, EPC, and EVChargingSation
are transformed and integrated into this ontology.</span>
